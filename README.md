### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

Other minor dependencies include but aren't limited to `tailwind-merge`(this is useful for building highly customizable library/primary components with tailwin), `react-svgr` (since there was no icon library provided out of the box, I used react-svgr to convert svg components to react components)
  

## Installation
You'll need to either fork or clone the repositry.<br>
Next, you run the command `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all the project dependencies.<br>

After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Constraints

This project was a fairly simple project. It tests the developers ability to work with React Components, React Hooks, NextJS tools and concept as well the developers ability to write clean, readable and reusable code, their understanding of design principles, user centered development and other skills required for frontend engineering. However, here are some of the constraints faced when building this project:
<ol>
  <li> Use of recent technologies:
  <p>Becase of the fast pace of emerging frontend technologies, there are alot of breaking changes that slow and impede development speed. Take an instance, when trying to create and run tests, I encountered issues with the latest issue of jest and Nextjs. I had to employ my research skills to resolve these issues</p>
  </li>
  <li> Design problems
  <p>One of the major issues I faced when building the application was the lack of design components and a clearly put navigation path for users(on desktop). This means that the users might not know that certain pages exist and just make use of the parts of the app that they are aware of.</p>
</ol>


### Recommendation

Here are simple steps I believe can take this application from a simple take home assignment to an actual sellable products or atleast and MVP
<ol>
  <li> Create a clear cut design document
  <p>The developers and designers should sit across board and discuss the product, the best design principles, user centered design and best practives for ease of development</p>
  </li>
  <li> Use of modern design concepts
  <p>One of the tools I employed by intuition is a skeleton loader, this a modern tool that gives the user higly presentable and easily understandble information without the use of texts. It lets tht user know that the page is loading without significant alterations of the page's layout</p>
  <li>Development documentation and requirement
  <p> While building this project, I made use of dependencies as I saw fit. In the long run, this will affect the overall performance of the code and lead to delay in development as packages can have conflicting sub packages. Hence, my suggestion here to create a detailed process for development that will limit this and also enhance the speed and quality of development
